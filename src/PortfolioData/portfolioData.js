        "In this paper, we propose the LegoNet - a system to classify and summarize legal judgments using Sentence Embedding, Capsule Networks and Unsupervised Extractive Summarization. To train and test the system, we have created a mini-corpus of Indian legal judgments which have been annotated according to the classes: Facts, Arguments, Evidences and Judgments. The proposed framework uses Sentence Embedding and Capsule Networks to classify parts of legal judgments into the classes mentioned above. This is then used by the extractive summarizer to generate a concise and succinct summary of the document grouped according to the above mentioned classes. Such a system could be used to help enable the Legal Community by speeding up the processes involving reading and summarizing legal documents which a Law professional would undertake in preparing for a case. The performance of the Machine Learning Model in this architecture can improve over time as more annotated training data is added to the corpus.",

        "The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest and widely used algorithms in Machine Learning applications such as Image Classification. Being based on the Euclidean distance the algorithm is quite simple and effective in most cases. However, it suffers from the problem of ”The Curse of Dimensionality” as the Euclidean distance becomes meaningless when the dimension of data becomes significantly high. In this paper we present a novel solution to this problem by making use of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which can extract the most important features automatically from the images. These features extracted by the CNN are of reduced dimensions and can effectively be used by the KNN to recognize the images. The results and comparisons show that the proposed method is also seen to reduce the time taken for testing while retaining high accuracy. The proposed technique achieved an accuracy of 96.92% on MNIST, 85.09% on Fashion MNIST and 95.17% on the A-Z Alphabets databases respectively.",

        "Automated feedback on pronunciation system on a smart phone is useful for a student trying to learn a new language at his or her own pace. The objective of our research is to implement a pronunciation training system with minimal language specific data. Our proposed system consists of an Android application as a front-end, and a pronunciation evaluation and mispronunciation detection framework as the back-end hosted on a cloud. We conduct our experiments on spoken isolated words in Kannada. Our pronunciation evaluation(for spoken word) implementation on the cloud involves training a classifier with features from Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF) and, without directly on LSF (without DTW). We study the performance of different machine learning algorithms for pronunciation rating. We propose a novel semi-supervised approach for detecting mispronounced segments of a word using Self Organizing Maps (SOM) that are also deployed on the cloud. Our implementation of SOM learns the features of an automatically segmented reference speech. The trained SOM is then used to determine the deviations in the learner's pronunciation. We evaluate our system on 1169 Kannada audio samples from students around 18 to 25 years of age. The Kannada words considered are taken from textbooks of first and second grade (considering learners as beginners who do not know Kannada) and include 2 to 5 syllable words. We report accuracy on binary classification and multi-class classification for different classifiers. The mispronounced segments detected using SOM correlate with the human ratings. Our approach of pronunciation evaluation and mispronunciation detection is based on minimal data and does not require a speech recognition system.",

        'Computer Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems can assist people learning to speak new languages by detecting and correcting mispronunciations. "Kannada Kali" is a prototype Android application that leverages learners\' increasing access to smartphones to evaluate the pronunciation of Kannada words and provide feedback using a cloud-based framework. A CAPT system typically uses an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) sub-system. For sufficient accuracy, ASR systems need to be trained using speech data from both native (L1) and non-native (L2) speakers. Since the latter type of data is particularly difficult to gather, we follow recent research efforts that seek to minimize the dependency on large speech corpora. We recorded 21 Kannada words (two to five syllables long) pronounced correctly by a Kannada teacher as templates, and 1169 samples of these words spoken by 19 native and non-native Kannada speakers aged 18 to 25 years. These samples were manually rated on a 5-point Likert scale by the Kannada teacher and used to train a neural network classifier for our application. "Kannada Kali" provides learners feedback that matches the teacher ratings with an accuracy of 86% on binary classification and 68% on multi-class classification. We also propose a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations using Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and report promising initial results.',

        "In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), quick and efficient FR techniques are often required in service robots. In a real time scenario, it is absolute that face image patterns observed by robots depends often on variations such as pose, light conditions, location of the robots (view point), etc. In addition to these constraints, the service robots are expected to be quick enough for FR so that they can be deployed in applications such as counting people, security and surveillance, directing humans, etc. In this paper, ORB, a computational expensive and quick feature extraction technique is used, which has been a panacea for the above mentioned constraints. One of the dimensionality reduction techniques called PCA (a tool which reduces high dimensional data to lower dimension while keeping most of the data) with its sublime advantages of reduction of storage and time is often used. But, in the FR system , the linear uncorrelated components of PCA doesn’t consider the non-linear factors such as occlusion and in such cases PCA fails to find the good representative direction. Kernel PCA (KPCA) which uses kernel methods considers even the non-linear factors and is proven to be more suitable than PCA, thus producing better results. By considering all these factors, our paper proposes a novel technique ORB-KPCA for FR along with Threshold Based Filtering (TBF). The proposed technique is proven to be efficient in both time and space by experimenting on three benchmark datasets (ORL, Faces96 and Grimace).",
